# Hi, I'm Vanessa

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## About me

I was born and raised in Ecuador and moved to the US on 2008. English is my second language. I live in Brooklyn with my husband, Eduardo, and my pup, Luna. I am 5' 6" if you are trying to guess.

## My role as an engineering manager
**TL;DR: I am here to make sure our team is successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our product, and improve our business.**

More granularly:

1.  I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our team's and our company's mission.
2.  I am here to make sure our team is successful and pointed in the right direction.
3.  I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us.
4.  I write some code too!

These are in approximate order of importance. If you are not successful and happy, our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, writing code will most likely not be my top priority.

Additionally: My job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. It is also not to be the "official decision maker" for our team. When I asked some other people for feedback on this README, one asked about this point, and then said something I thought was poignant: "I am _accountable_ for the decisions the team make, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time."

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback face-to-face (Zoom), that's my preference. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member or colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.

## One-on-ones

I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each week for a one-on-one. I schedule all my one-on-ones on the same day (Tuesdays) but I will sometimes need to reschedule these due to conflicts with one-off meetings that I must attend. In that case, I will try to reschedule it for the same week. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust. I will probably schedule our first one-on-one for an hour just to be sure we have time to go over the team mission and other introductory things; don't feel the need to prepare for it.

One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. If you'd like to give me a brief status update on things you're working on or that you're stuck on, that is fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to satnd down, a Slack message on the relevanr project channel, or a separate meeting.

We use a tool called Lattice for our one-on-ones. To faciliate the conversation, I follow a general agenda, and I encourage you to add some things throughout the week that you want to chat about. We also can keep track of shared notes and action items. Usually, my agenda will include how last week went for you, what are your priorities for the current week, roadblocks, feedback, and personal development. 




### Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing continuously, including in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. My goal is for you to never be unsure about how you're performing (and how I think you're performing). If you ever feel unsure about either of these things, please let me know.

## My schedule

I currently work entirely remotely. I generally consider my work hours to be 10am to 6pm EST, though this varies somewhat depending on meetings. If I am not available during my normal hours for some reason, I will mark it on my calendar. 

I have recurring focus times scheduled in my calendar but these are somewhat flexible. Just ask me if you want to schedule over those times.


### After-hours communication

I will get a sense of your normal working hours as we begin working together, and I will make a strong effort not to message you outside of these hours because I know many people have Slack notifications sent to their phone. If I send you a Slack message or email, you should not feel obligated to respond until you are working. With Slack I tend to use the "schedule message" functionality if I am sending a message outside of your usual working times, since it tends to trigger a notification. If you are receiving after-hours Slack messages from me with any frequency, please let me know—it may mean I'm misunderstanding the hours you normally work.

If for any reason I do urgently need you outside of your normal working hours due to an incident, I will page you (assuming you have been given a Pager Duty account) or be clear about the urgency to reach you in a Slack message. This will happen _extremely_ rarely (if ever).

Similarly, if you email or Slack me outside of my working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until the next working day. If you have something non-urgent you want to tell me and it's outside of my work hours, I don't mind if you Slack me, though I always appreciate an explicit note that it's non-urgent! If you need me urgently outside of work hours, a phone call or message is the best way to get hold of me, though you can always try Slack too first.

## If you need something

1.  Slack me.
2.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule. I have recurring focus times scheduled in my calendar but these are somewhat flexible. Just ask me if you want to schedule over those times.


## Caveat

Take this document with a grain of salt. I something here seems off, bring it up to me in one-on-one or over Slack.

## Expectations of you

This document is meant to focus on how I work and what to expect from me. We will discuss expectations I have of you and the rest of the team soon after we begin working together, and I will resources with specific onboarding information.

## My interests
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets :smiley:

* Travel. I like using my PTO to visit other countries and get to know new places I've never been. I would love to hear where you have been and what your favorite places are.

* Restaurants/Food. I moved to NYC for the food! And I also travel for food. I would love to hear recommendation of places you love.

* Luna. I have a Australian Labradoodle named Luna. 

* Ecuador. If you plan to visit, I am happy to give you tips or recommendations.
